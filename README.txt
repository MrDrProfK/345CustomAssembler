345CustomAssembler 

Custom assembler built for use in the Fall 2018 ESE 345 final project.

Please note...

The # symbol signifies the start of a comment. As such, text to the right of the #
symbol is ignored by the assembler.

Input file ext: 	.fudor
Output file ext:	.binary

The assembler was designed to produce an output file with the same basename as
the input file.

Debug mode can be enabled using the --debug flag on the command line.
